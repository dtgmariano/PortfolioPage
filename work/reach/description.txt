Reach 2020 is an European Consortium that aims to help elderly by focusing on stimulating healthy eating among seniors. The stakeholders of the projects requested my team to research a particular group of seniors in Eindhoven. These seniors participates (takes part?) in a weekly cooking activity with students of the Summa College, as part of the Lokaal+ initiative. Further more, the stakeholders asked my team to develop a digital prototype for a smart table that would engage seniors in food-related activities. The interactive table, built by researchers of the Technical University of München.

During four weeks we executed the following activities:

Contextual inquiry with seniors during a cooking activity;
clustered qualitative data from the contextual inquiry using affinity diagram;
answered business questions by following the design sprint method;
prototyped a cooking-aid application for an interactive table;
conducted usability tests with 8 users;
ran three iterations of the design process.
